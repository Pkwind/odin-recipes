    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Ground meat: This meatball recipe uses a blend of ground beef, ground veal, and ground pork. You can switch it up depending on what you have on hand.
        </li>
        <li>
            Seasonings and herbs: These meatballs are flavored with fresh garlic, fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley, and ground black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Eggs: Eggs keep the meatballs from drying out and they act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the ingredients together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cheese: You'll need a cup of freshly grated Romano cheese. If you can, avoid the pre-grated stuff for this recipe.
        </li>
        <li>
            Italian bread: Slightly stale Italian bread is preferable. If your bread feels soft, try letting it sit out overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Water: Slowly add water to the mixture before you roll the meatballs. It'll keep the meatballs nice and moist. Some reviewers prefer to use milk.
        </li>
        <li>
            Olive oil: Fry the meatballs in olive oil.
        </li>
    </ul>
